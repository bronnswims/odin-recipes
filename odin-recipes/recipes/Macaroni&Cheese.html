        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <li>
          Bring a pot of water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni until al dente,
          about 8 minutes.

            While the macaroni is cooking, go ahead and start on the roux. A
            roux is a thickening agent made of one part fat and one part flour
            that makes up the base of this creamy mac and cheese. To make the
            roux, start by melting butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add
            flour, salt, and pepper and stir until smooth. Slowly pour in milk
            and stir until the mixture is smooth and bubbling. Be careful to not
            let the milk burn.

            Finally, the most crucial step: Add cheese! Slowly stir in Cheddar
            cheese until smooth and melted. We recommend you grate your own
            cheese because pre-shredded cheese won't incorporate into the
            mixture as well as block cheese.
