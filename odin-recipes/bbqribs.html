    <p>
      This BBQ ribs recipe may be different than others you've tried, but for
      super tender ribs, give it a try! Lean, country-style pork ribs are boiled
      in seasoned water until tender, then finished up in the oven under a
      blanket of your favorite barbecue sauce as they bake to perfection. That's
      it! Back to simplicity, back to country life.

    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
      <li><p>Gather all ingredients.</p></li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Place ribs in a large pot and cover with water. Stir in kosher salt,
          garlic powder, and pepper, and bring water to a boil over medium heat.
          Continue to boil until ribs are tender, 40 to 45 minutes.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          While the ribs are boiling, preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165
          degrees C).
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Remove ribs from the pot, and place them in a 9x13-inch baking dish.
          Pour barbeque sauce over ribs. Cover the baking dish with aluminum
          foil.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Bake in the preheated oven until the internal temperature of the pork
          has reached 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Serve hot and enjoy!</p>
